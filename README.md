# dog-bot-opensrc
A bot me and [Alt](https://github.com/A1Asriel) made.

# Installation

First, download the [latest release](https://github.com/IsTheWit/dog-bot-opensrc/releases/latest), and unzip the `Dog.Bot.zip` file. Open up a Command Prompt, navigate to the dog-bot folder, and run `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
Then, create a text document called `token.txt` in the same folder as `main.py`. Inside the text file, put in your bot token.

## Opening the bot

After that, run `main.py` by either double clicking on it in Explorer, or typing `python main.py` in a Command Prompt.

# FAQ

## Why doesn't the bot work? I have all the libraries for the bot.

Create a file called `token.txt` in the same directory as the `main.py` file, with the contents containing **only the bot token.**
Launch the `main.py` file and it should work.

## What are the commands?
